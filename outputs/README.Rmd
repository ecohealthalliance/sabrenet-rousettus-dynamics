# Calculated Prevalences

## Raw

Prevalences calculated as a % of number of samples collected, with corrected values for fecal samples

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(raw_prev)
```

## Modeled

Prevalances calculated as baseline (intercept) probability of infection of single samples from the Generalized Additive model, conditional on mean bat and environment variables.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(model_prev)
```

## Tables

## Body Condition and Prevalence by demographic group

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table_fmi_demo)
```

# Figures

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0("## ", svg_plots, "\n\n![](", basename(svg_plots), ")"), sep = "\n\n")
```

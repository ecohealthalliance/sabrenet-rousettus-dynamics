Notes:

- Should we model the viruses as exclusive outcomes?
- What about the one beta-clade 4?
- We estimate fraction juvenile from the ones caught in these data?

Key Tests:
(For "positivity", we ask this for each virus and for all viruses)
-  Do fecal samples have different peak periods than rectal?  For each virus or all?
-  Do fecal samples have different average or peak positivity than rectal? For each virus or all?
-  Does time or season have an effect on posititivty
-  Does FMI have an effect on positivity?
-  Does % juveniles have an effect on positivity?


What groups are worth looking at? Here's the breakdown of detections by group:
```
> dat_cleaned |> filter(sample_type == "Rectal swab") |> group_by(age, gender, reproductive_condition, reproductive_status_based_on_condition) |> summarize(cov_detections = sum(cov_detected), n = n(), frac = scales::percent(cov_detections/n))
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'age', 'gender', 'reproductive_condition'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
# A tibble: 13 Ã— 7
# Groups:   age, gender, reproductive_condition [11]

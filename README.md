This repository contains data and R code which are supplements to:

*Viral maintenance and excretion dynamics of coronaviruses within an
Egyptian rousette fruit bat colony- considerations for spillover*, by
Geldenhuys et al.Â (2022)

## Repository Structure and Reproducibility

-   `data/` contains data from the study and a data dictionary
    describing all variables.
-   `R/` contains functions used in this analysis.
-   `reports/` contains literate code for R Markdown reports generated
    in the analysis
-   `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures.
-   This project uses the
    [{targets}](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/) framework to
    organize build steps for analysis pipeline. The steps are defined in
    the `_targets.R` file and the workflow can be executed by running
    `run.R` via `source("run.R")` in your R terminal or `Rscript run.R`
    in your system shell. The schematic figure below summarizes the
    steps. (It uses `mermaid.js` syntax and should display as a graph on
    GitHub. It can also we viewed by pasting the code into
    <https://mermaid.live>.)

-   This project requires R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22). This project
    uses the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) framework to
    record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions
    used are recorded in `renv.lock` and code used to manage
    dependencies is in `renv/` and other files in the root project
    directory. On starting an R session in the working directory, run
    `renv::restore()` to install R package dependencies.
    -   The package also requires
        [`cmdstan`](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) to be
        installed. Version 2.29.2 is used. If not already installed, run
        `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(version = "2.29.2")` after
        `renv::restore()`
